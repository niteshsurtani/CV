# Research Projects
### WavePipe (September 2014 – present)
 I’m working on a USDA-sponsored software that enables
health science researchers to run studies that require
monitoring subjects via mobile devices.
 (Java EE – MySQL – DataNucleus)

### Targoman (November 2013 – June 2014)
An online, computer-assisted translation manager software,
 which using Targoman’s translation engine, would
 help teams of translators with their jobs by providing
 features like automatic translation, spell- and grammar-
 checking, translation memory, and terminology manager.
 I also built targoman.com’s new home page and many
 internal analytics tools.
 (Ruby on Rails – Ember.js – PostgreSQL – Node.js)

### Kavandeh Search Engine (July 2011 – April 2012)
Improving link-based Web page ranking algorithms in
 a Persian-only search engine, using various statistical
 and heuristic methods.
 Our team of two heavily improved upon Nutch’s scoring,
 parsing, crawling, and spam detection submodules, and
 usedWebKit’s rendering engine for detecting semantically
 significant parts of a (rendered) Web page and assigning
 more weight to links in such areas.
 (Apache Nutch & Solr – WebKit – Java – C++)

### Visual WebPage Segmentation (March 2012 – June 2012)
Detecting Web page structure with statistical analysis
 of the visual representation of the rendered page content,
 and using that structure for improving ranking algorithms
 in a search engine.
 (Node.js – PhantomJS – MongoDB)

### Baygan Database (January 2011 – June 2011)
An extendable and clearly-modulated framework for
 introducing students to the intricacies of relational 
database design. Inspired by pintos.
 (Java – ANTLR)

### Embedded Search Engine (June and July 2010)
A complete, single-purpose search engine (all parts written
 from scratch), designed to use minimal online memory
 (60 MB), for indexing and searching the contents of the
 English Wikipedia.
 (Java)
